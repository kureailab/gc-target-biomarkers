To explore potential biomarkers in human gastric cancer NGS data

### Potential biomarkers derived from 10+ gastric cancer (GC) mRNA-seq cohorts
`bkRNAseq_GC`
### Cell-type specific potential biomarkers derived from 9 GC scRNA-seq cohorts
`scRNAseq_GC`
### Identifying isoform usages distinct to GC tumors
